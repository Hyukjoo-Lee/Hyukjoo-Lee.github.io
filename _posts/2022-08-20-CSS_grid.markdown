**CSS Grid**

#### Why do we need CSS grid?

- CSS grid is the 2-D layout system for webpage design.
- This system helps to design the complex layout.
- Flexbox makes it easy to put elements on the left & right side & center. However, there is a limit to making a grid format.
- Similar to the flexbox, you should talk mostly with a parent, not with a child.

#### rows and columns

- grid-template-rows: tracks the size of rows.
- grid-template-columns: tracks the size of columns.
- gap: shortcut for multiple rows & columns.
- To give the same size to height & width for rows OR columns, you can utilize repeat() function.
- e.g. grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 200px)

#### grid template areas

- grid-template-areas is property to organize the grid structure.
- You can organize the structure by defining what elements will be used for.
- e.g.

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  /*  auto: use all areas  */
  grid-template-columns: auto 200px;
  grid-template-rows: 100px repeat(2, 200px) 100px;
  grid-template-areas:
    /* define what each element will be used for */
    "header header header header"
    /* .: allowing the empty space */
    "content content . nav"
    "content content . nav"
    "footer footer footer footer";
}

.header {
  background-color: aquamarine;
  grid-area: header;
}
```

#### rows and columns

- There is another way to make the structure.
- You can give values to each elements like...

```
grid-column-start: {value}
grid-column-end: {value}
grid-row-start: {value}
grid-row-end: {value}
```

- grid-column-start, grid-row-start: starting with a value upper than 1.
- grid-column-end, grid-row-end: ending with a value upper than 2.

```CSS
    /* shortcuts */
    grid-row: 1 / 4
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
  /* You can also count from the end of elements (-1,-2). */
```

- span: show how many spaces are allocated.

```CSS
    /* 2 rows & 2 columns */
    grid-row: span 2;
    grid-column: span 2;
```

- Notice that it does not express the start & end point, so you should consider the relationship between other elements.
- e.g.

```CSS
.nav {
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.content {

  /* Since there is no starting point for content, this content does not show. */
  grid-row: span 2;
  /* You should define the start point for content like..

  grid-row: 2 / span 2;
  OR
  span for nav tag */

}
```

#### line naming

- You can give a name for lines.

```CSS
  grid-template-columns:
  [first-line] 100px [second-line] 100px
  [third-line] 100px [fourth-line] 100px [fifth-line]
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, [my-line] 100px );
  grid-column: first-line / fourth-line;
  grid-row: my-line 2 / my-line 4;
```

#### grid template

- 1fr: fraction means taking as many as spaces available in the 'container'. (more elastic than pixel).

```CSS
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
/* takes as many as spaces available in the container, and repeats four times. */
```

- For responsive design, you'd better use 1fr or % than px.
- You need to set height when you are using fractions; note that the grid does not have any height.
- height: 50vh (half-size of the screen)
- grid-template: shortcut of grid-template-areas, grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows.

```CSS
  gird-template:
  "header header header header" 1fr
  "content content content nav" 2fr
  "footer footer footer footer" 1fr / 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; (row size / column size)

  /* + naming */
  gird-template:
  [header-start] "header header header header" 1fr [header-end]
  [content-start] "content content content nav" 2fr [conent-end]
  [footer-start] "footer footer footer footer" 1fr [footer-end] / 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
```

#### place items

- Inside a grid container, justify-items, align-items default is 'stretch' for children.

- justify-items = horizontal, align-items &rarr; vertical.

  ```
  start: place items to the start point of a cell.
  center: to the center of a cell.
  end: the end of a cell.
  ```

- items mean cells, while content does the whole grid.
  - justify(align)-items: moves grid elements inside cells.
  - justify(align)-content: moves the whole grid.

```
  Shortcut
  place-items: y(align) x(justify);
  place-content: y(align) x(justify);
  place-self: y(align) x(justify);
```

#### auto columns and rows

- grid-auto-flow: determine how the cell are located.
- if there are more rows than you set on the grid template, the remains will locate below without height.
- You may need grid-auto-rows: when you specify the size of the row, remains will locate below with the height you set.
- if the flow is columns, it plays a role in the same as flex-direction, which means remains will locate on the right side, not below.

#### minmax

- you can define minimum & maximum size when the display of browser is shrunk or expanded.
- e.g. grid-template-columns: repeat(5, minmax(100px, 1fr));

#### auto-fit & auto-fill

- they are good values for the responsive design with only repeat function.

1. auto-fill: it fills empty spaces with new empty cells. (size is fixed, cells are growing)
2. auto-fit: it fills empty spaces with existing elements.(growing elements' size depending on browser size)

```CSS
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr));
```

##### min-content & max-content

- it designs how contents look like.
- max-content: maximum width or height of the content.
  (it might cause the overflow.)
- min-content: minimum width of the content.
  (the content might be as small as the longest word.)
- collaborates with repeat() and minmax.
